# Deep-learning-assisted-tool-for-atrial-fibrillation-detection
This project aims to create a deep learning tool that detects Atrial Fibrillation(AF), a life threatning heart disease, from the segmented ECG signals. This is accomplished by classifying the ECG signal. The input for the proposed system is a time varying numeric value. The tool processes the dataset to remove noise from the ECG using Discrete Wavelet Transform method and Pan-Thompkins method. The QRS complex is obtained from the pre-processed data. The QRS complex plays the major role in detection AF detection. The QRS complex is then segmented based on the peak value of the QRS complex. These segments of the ECG wave are fed to a ResNet18 classifier to detect whether the input ECG is an AF.
